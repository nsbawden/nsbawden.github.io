title:  "Homesteading - Travel By Yes"
---

Today I was inspired by `[Natalie Kinsey](http://www.playnexus.com/)` to locate our old assets and tools from the `travelbyyes.com website` and create a *homestead* for them on github. Now all those *old things* will live on forever in the cloud.

You can check out the tools on the [homestead wiki](https://github.com/nsbawden/TravelByYes/wiki).

All the work done to create these tools is now donated foward to posterity!

Your welcome,

d'Artagnan
